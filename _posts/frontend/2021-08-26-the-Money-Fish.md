## The lie

I have created a website for my business, so now everyone can see it. 

### The truth

Creating your website is just the first step, you have to advertise your website so that people can go online specifically to visit your website. Websites surely have potential to reach millions of target clients for your business, but if you don't advertise the website it will get you zero clients, yes, zero. Nobody will even know it exists. Below is a list of items you can create and use to help you get more website visitors.

- Design E-Fliers.
- Advertise your website on Facebook.
- Advertise your website on Youtube.
- Print fliers and hand deliver them to your intended clients.
- Send your clients bulk SMS with special offers encouraging them to visit your website.
- Write useful articles/ blogs on your website and share them with people, especially articles related to the work that you do.
